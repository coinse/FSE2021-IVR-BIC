# f322be0

[`f322be0`](../commits/f322be0.diff) was identified as the BIC of `Closure-107b`, `Closure-114b`, `Closure-118b`, and `Closure-130b`.

As you can see in the commit diff file, the modes of multiple files are changed by the commit:
```diff
diff --git a/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/SourceFile.java b/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/SourceFile.java
old mode 100755
new mode 100644
```
, and only the source file `src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/SourceInformationAnnotator.java`
and its corresponding test is modified.

However, for all four bugs, none of the bug-revealing test cases executes the class
`SourceInformationAnnotator`, which means that the modifications in the source file
do not affect the observed failures. Therefore, this commit cannot be a BIC of the bugs.
