# 2885ba1

[`2885ba1`](../commits/2885ba1.diff) was identified as the BIC of `Math-13b`.
It modifies two files except for test code:
- `src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/direct/BaseAbstractMultivariateVectorOptimizer.java`
- `src/main/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/general/AbstractLeastSquaresOptimizer.java`

`Math-13b` has a single bug-revealing test case: `org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.PolynomialFitterTest:testLargeSample`.
We ran the test case on the buggy snapshot of `Math-13b` (`a6b2e99`), and confirmed that it executes some of the modified files, not the modified methods.

To be safe, we ran the bug revealing test case on the previous commit of `2885ba1` (`2885ba1~1`), and the test still produces a failure on the version. Therefore, `2885ba1` is not the bug introducing commit that caused the failure on `a6b2e99`.

```bash
defects4j checkout -p Math -v 13b -w /tmp/Math-13b-check
cd /tmp/Math-13b-check
git checkout -b d4j 
git checkout -b check
git reset --hard 2885ba1~1
git checkout d4j -- .defects4j.config
git checkout d4j -- defects4j.build.properties
cp ~/workspace/resources/Math-13b-PolynomialFitterTest.java src/test/java/org/apache/commons/math3/optimization/fitting/PolynomialFitterTest.java
rm -rf build; defects4j compile; defects4j test -t org.apache.commons.math3.optimization.fitting.PolynomialFitterTest::testLargeSample
cat failing_tests # java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

However, there is one unresolved issue: we found that the real buggy snapshot of `Math-13b` and the isolated buggy version of `Math-13b` fail due to the different reason (with the same error message but a different call stack). Thereby, on the real buggy snapshot, the bug revealing test case does not execute the method `squareRoot`, where the fixing commit of `Math-13b` modifies. This makes `2885ba1`, which first introduced the `squareRoot`, being filtered out by the BIC search space. We need more discussion on this.
